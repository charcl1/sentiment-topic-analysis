# Sentiment Analysis

This project looks at PUBG Mobile reviews from the Play Store to understand players’ sentiment about the game.

The goal is to get a sense of the user sentiment and figure out ways to improve the overall experience.

The data includes the review text and the rating (1–5 stars) associated with it.

## Workflow
**Exploration** - Explored the variables and their distributions

**Cleaning Data & Feature Engineering** - Removed numbers/whitespace, converted text to lowercase, and tokenized data 

**Sentiment Analysis** - Applied Vader to quantify positive and negative sentiment and visualized key terms with word clouds

**Topic Modeling** - Extracted topics from text using BERTopic to identify underlying themes

## Insights & Recommendations:

Most users have a positive view of the game, while the negative reviews tend to be only slightly negative.

Many of the negative reviews are about users preferring the older version of PUBG and reporting network or account issues. Addressing these issues shows where things can be improved.
